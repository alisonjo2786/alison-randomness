Background for this work can be summed-up by my help request message to the d4g group:

> I want to include ALL values of a multi-value content field in my Pathauto pattern.
> 
> Anyone know how to do that?  I'm striking out on the Googles so far.
> 
> (I know I can use :0, :1, :2, etc., for multi-value field tokens, but, I really need to just explode 'em all right there.)
